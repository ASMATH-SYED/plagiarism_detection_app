This project implements a plagiarism detection system using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Features
- Detects AI-generated vs human-written text
- Calculates plagiarism similarity percentage
- Displays most similar content
- Web-based interface using Streamlit

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF
- Cosine Similarity
- Streamlit

## How It Works
1. User enters text
2. Text preprocessing is applied
3. TF-IDF converts text to numerical form
4. Machine learning model predicts content type
5. Cosine similarity calculates plagiarism score

## Application
Useful for students, teachers, and academic plagiarism checking.
